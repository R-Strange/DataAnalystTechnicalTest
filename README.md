# Data Analyst Technical Test

## BRIEF

Create a program. This program will:

1. Accept a string piped from commandline with STDIN. This string is the path to a folder
2. Verify that the string is correct
3. Handle both UNIX and Windows pathing
4. Find every .csv file in the folder and subfolders, and ignore every other file
5. fail successfully and verbosely if an error occurs
6. use STDERR to signal failure
7. Pipe out a list of the csv files that are distinct with STDOUT.
8. Estimate the efficiency of your program by time and by algorithmic complexity.

This should represent 1 - 2 hours of work.
